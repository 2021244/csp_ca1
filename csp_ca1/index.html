            <h1> Eye colour</h1>

            <p>
                <strong> Eye colour</strong> is a polygenic phenotypic character determined by two distinct factors: the
                pigmentation of the eye's iris<sup>[1][2]</sup> and the frequency-dependence of the scattering of light
                by the turbid medium in the stroma of the iris.<sup>[3]:9</sup>
            </p>

            <p> In humans, the pigmentation of the iris varies from light brown to black, depending on the concentration
                of melanin in the iris pigment epithelium (located on the back of the iris), the melanin content within
                the iris stroma (located at the front of the iris), and the cellular density of the
                stroma.<sup>[4]</sup> The appearance of blue and green, as well as hazel eyes, results from the Tyndall
                scattering of light in the stroma, a phenomenon similar to that which accounts for the blueness of the
                sky called Rayleigh scattering.<sup>[5]</sup> Neither blue nor green pigments are ever present in the
                human iris or ocular fluid.<sup>[3][6]</sup> Eye color is thus an instance of structural color and
                varies depending on the lighting conditions, especially for lighter-colored eyes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The brightly colored eyes of many bird species result from the presence of other pigments, such as
                pteridines, purines, and carotenoids.<sup>[7]</sup> Humans and other animals have many phenotypic
                variations in eye color.<sup>[8]</sup>
            </p>

            <p>
                Thegenetics and inheritance of eye color in humans is complicated. So far, as many as 15 genes have been
                associated with eye color inheritance. Some of the eye-color genes include OCA2 and HERC2.<sup>[9]</sup>
                The earlier belief that blue eye color is a simple recessive trait has been shown to be incorrect. The
                genetics of eye color are so complex that almost any parent-child combination of eye colors can
                occur.<sup>[10][11]</sup> However, OCA2 gene polymorphism, close to proximal 5' regulatory region,
                explains most human eye-color variation.<sup>[12]</sup></p>

            <h2>Genetic determination</h2>

            <p>Eye color is an inherited trait influenced by more than one gene.<sup>[13][14]</sup> These
                genes are
                sought using associations to small changes in the genes themselves and in neighboring genes. These
                changes are known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs. The actual number of genes that
                contribute to eye color is currently unknown, but there are a few likely candidates. A study in
                Rotterdam (2009) found that it was possible to predict eye color with more than 90% accuracy for
                brown and blue using just six SNPs.<sup>[15]</sup> There is evidence that as many as 16 different
                genes could be responsible for eye color in humans; however, the main two genes associated with eye
                color variation are OCA2 and HERC2, and both are localized in Chromosome 15.<sup>[9]</sup></p>

            <p>The gene OCA2 (OMIM: 203200), when in a variant form, causes the pink eye color and
                hypopigmentation
                common in human albinism. (The name of the gene is derived from the disorder it causes,
                oculocutaneous albinism type II.) Different SNPs within OCA2 are strongly associated with blue and
                green eyes as well as variations in freckling, mole counts, hair and skin tone. The polymorphisms
                may be in an OCA2 regulatory sequence, where they may influence the expression of the gene product,
                which in turn affects pigmentation.<sup>[12]</sup> A specific mutation within the HERC2 gene, a gene
                that regulates OCA2 expression, is partly responsible for blue eyes.<sup>[16]</sup> Other genes
                implicated in eye color variation are SLC24A4<sup>[17]</sup> and TYR.<sup>[17]</sup> A 2010 study on
                eye color variation into hue and saturation values using high-resolution digital full-eye
                photographs found three new loci for a total of ten genes, and now about 50% of eye colour variation
                can be explained.<sup>[18]</sup></p>

        <section id="Ancient DNA and eye color in Europe">
            <h2>Ancient DNA and eye color in Europe</h2>
            <p>People of European descent show the greatest variety in eye color of any population worldwide. Recent
                advances in ancient DNA technology have revealed some of the history of eye color in Europe. All
                European Mesolithic hunter-gatherer remains so far investigated have shown genetic markers for
                light-colored eyes, in the case of western and central European hunter-gatherers combined with dark skin
                color. The later additions to the European gene pool, the Early Neolithic farmers from Anatolia and the
                Yamnaya Copper Age/Bronze Age pastoralists (possibly the Proto-Indo-European population) from the area
                north of the Black Sea appear to have had much higher incidences of dark eye color alleles, and alleles
                giving rise to lighter skin, than the original European population.<sup>[19][20]</sup></p>

        </section>
        <section id="Classification of color"></section>
        <h2>Classification of color</h2>
        <p>Iris color can provide a large amount of information about a person, and a classification of colors may be
            useful in documenting pathological changes or determining how a person may respond to ocular
            pharmaceuticals.<sup>[21]</sup> Classification systems have ranged from a basic light or dark description to
            detailed gradings employing photographic standards for comparison.<sup>[21]</sup> Others have attempted to
            set objective standards of color comparison.<sup>[22]</sup></p>

        <p> Normal eye colors range from the darkest shades of brown to the lightest tints of blue.<sup>[13]</sup> To
            meet the need for standardized classification, at once simple yet detailed enough for research purposes,
            Seddon et al. developed a graded system based on the predominant iris color and the amount of brown or
            yellow pigment present.[<sup>[23]</sup> There are three pigment colors that determine, depending on their
            proportion, the outward appearance of the iris, along with structural color. Green irises, for example, have
            some yellow and the blue structural color. Brown irises contain more or less melanin. Some eyes have a dark
            ring around the iris, called a limbal ring.</p>

        <p> Eye color in non-human animals is regulated differently. For example, instead of blue as in humans,
            autosomal recessive eye color in the skink species Corucia zebrata is black, and the autosomal dominant
            color is yellow-green.<sup>[24]</sup></p>

        <p> As the perception of color depends on viewing conditions (e.g., the amount and kind of illumination, as well
            as the hue of the surrounding environment), so does the perception of eye color.<sup>[25]</sup></p>
        <section id="Change in eye colour">
            <h2>Change in eye colour></h2>
            <p>
                Most newborn babies who have European ancestry have light-colored eyes. As the child develops,
                melanocytes (cells found within the iris of human eyes, as well as skin and hair follicles) slowly begin
                to produce melanin. Because melanocyte cells continually produce pigment, in theory eye color can be
                changed. Adult eye color is usually established between 3 and 6 months of age, though this can be
                later.<sup>[27]</sup> Observing the iris of an infant from the side using only transmitted light with no
                reflection from the back of the iris, it is possible to detect the presence or absence of low levels of
                melanin. An iris that appears blue under this method of observation is more likely to remain blue as the
                infant ages. An iris that appears golden contains some melanin even at this early age and is likely to
                turn from blue to green or brown as the infant ages.</p>

            <p> Changes (lightening or darkening) of eye colors during early childhood, puberty, pregnancy, and
                sometimes after serious trauma (like heterochromia) do represent cause for a plausible argument stating
                that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body.</p>

            <p>Studies on Caucasian twins, both fraternal and identical, have shown that eye color over time can be
                subject to change, and major demelanization of the iris may also be genetically determined. Most eye
                color changes have been observed or reported in the Caucasian population with hazel and amber
                eyes.[<sup>[28]</sup> Under the same environmental conditions, there may be disagreement over the color
                of an object between two different people;[further explanation needed] the factor that causes this
                discrepancy is the presence of melanin in the iris, which is the main factor in determining eye color.
                The higher the amount of melanin in the iris and the denser the texture of the melanin, the darker the
                color of a person's eyes; the same melanin concentration also depends on many factors such as hereditary
                and environmental ones.</p>

            <p>The most important role of melanin in the iris is to protect the eyes from the sun's harmful
                rays.<sup>[29]</sup> People with lighter eye colors, such as blue or green, have lessened protection
                from the sun, and so need greater protection from the sun's rays than those with darker eye
                colors.[citation needed]</p>

            <p>The human eye consists of two types of light and color receptors in the retina. Cylindrical cells are the
                photoreceptors of the eye that have a black and white vision and, depending on the amount of light
                received from the environment, determine the amount of darkness and brightness of objects. The number of
                cylindrical cells is more than the number of color receptors and reaches about 120 million; cone cells,
                which are smaller in number than light receptors, have color vision and are divided into three distinct
                categories, each of which recognizes one of the colors blue, red, and green, allowing the individual to
                distinguish colors.<sup>[30]</sup></p>

            <p>When a person is exposed to sunlight, the rays of sunlight hit a part of the back of the eye called the
                'yellow spot'. The cylindrical cells receive these rays, make a neural message from them, and send them
                to the occipital region of the brain, where they are examined and answered if necessary. At this time, a
                large amount of ultraviolet light is received by the eye and destroys parts of the light
                receptors.<sup>[31]</sup> Because people with bright eyes have less melanin in their eyes than people
                with dark eyes, the lack of this protective factor means that the light receptors in their eyes are more
                damaged and destroyed than in other people. This difference in the number of light receptors in the eyes
                of different people causes a difference in the amount of light they receive from the environment; for
                this reason, people with bright eyes see colors a little darker than others. However, this amount is so
                small that it is not very visible in everyday life and only appears as a slight difference of opinion
                between people with different eye colors.[citation needed]
